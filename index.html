<h1> SQL Essays</h1>
<p>
   INNER JOIN selects all rows from multiple tables as long as there is a match between certain columns. It combines rows from two or more tables. If there are only 2 tables, then inner join works by combining column values of two tables (Ex: Table 1 and Table 2) based upon specific criteria. SQL compares each row of Table 1 with each row of Table 2 to find all pairs of rows with specific commonalities. If the join criteria is satisfied, column values for each matched pair of rows of A and B are combined into one row with the corresponding results.

    Computer Science is the study of the theory and practice of how computers work. Computer scientists learn multiple programming languages and how those languages work. They also study software, operating systems, algorithms, and everything else that makes a computer function. Data scientists, on the other hand, analyze computer data and find patterns, insights, and trends within this data. In data science, algorithmic principles are applied to greater areas of uncertainty, often producing answers that are based largely on probability. Data scientists use more mathematical, specifically statistical, methods to analyze data. Even though computer scientists and data scientists work in somewhat similar ways, computer scientists focus more on how computers work, while data scientists focus more on how computer data influences how computers are used.
